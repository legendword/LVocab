## Deployment

#### Requirements

- Apache 2
- PHP 5 or PHP 7

#### Installation

Put all files in your localhost server documents directory.

For Mac OS X, it's most likely `/Library/WebServer/Documents/`

Access this application through `index.html`

#### Login Support

By default, you're automatically logged in with user id `1`

**You don't need to change this if you're using this yourself.**

Open `config.php`, and change `$uid = "1"` to any code that enables login detection and sets `$uid` to a unique user identifier.
